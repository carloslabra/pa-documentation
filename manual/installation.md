# Installation

This section explains how to install P4 on a Linux or Windows system.  If installing for many users, administrator priviledges will be required.  If only installing for yourself, no such priviledges should be necessary.  You will need to be on a machine which is connected to the internet.

Begin by getting an installer executable from Particle Analytics.  If you do not already have this executable, contact _support@particle-analytics.com_ or visit [our website](www.particle-analytics.com/contact.php).

## Running the Installer

Once you run the installer, a window like this should appear ...

The should be no need to edit the _Settings_, simply hit _Next_ to get the next installer window ...

Here, you set the installation folder.  Those without administrator priviledges will need to chose a location which is appropriate to the priviledges that they do have.  Whilst the image above shows an x64 windows installer, a linux installer will chose a different (more appropriate) default installation location.

The next job is to decide whether you're are opting for a Complete or a Custom build.  This probably comes down to whether you want documentation, or not.  Installing documentation is recommended.

Accepting the _End User Licence Agreement_ is a necessary step if you with to continue with the installation.  You are encouraged to read this agreement before accepting.

The penultimate screen will show a progress bar as the different components install.  Once this is finished, simply hit _Finish_ on the final installer window.


## Your Licence

When you first run P4, a window like this should appear ...

Copy the _Name_, _Operating System_ and _Sysinfo_ data from that window and contact Particle Analytics (_support@particle-analytics.com_) with the information.  We will then give you a licence file specific to your machine.  Save this file in a location you can find again.

Next, 
 * Pull down the _Help > Register from file..._ option.   
 * Navigate to your licence file, select it, and open it
