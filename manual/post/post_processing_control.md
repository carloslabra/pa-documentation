# Processing control

The process control within Particle-Analytics is defined by 3 main commands:

* (![](img/pre_run_exec.png)) start processing
* (![](img/pre_run_info.png)) show info, and 
* (![](img/pre_run_stop.png)) cancel.

* **Start Processing** : Initiate the processing of the simulation results. Check the settings and launch the process.

* **View Run Info** : Shows a window with the evolution of the process, as shown below.

* **Cancel Process** : Stop the execution. All the results generated thus far can be visualized in
the post-process.
