# Processing control

The process control within Particle-Analytics is defined by 3 main commands:

* (![](img/pre_run_exec.png)) start processing
* (![](img/pre_run_info.png)) show info, and 
* (![](img/pre_run_stop.png)) stop processing.

#### Start Processing

Initiate the processing of the simulation results. Check the settings and launch the process.

#### Show Info 

Shows a window with the evolution of the process, as shown below.

the post-process.
